  The docs were created from a ReadMe export that was only cleaned up in terms of renaming files to force table of contents ordering, and to use expected directory structure for categories/pages/subpages.
  If the pages had had images (they had none), then images would also have had to be downloaded ,added to github, and their references updated.
